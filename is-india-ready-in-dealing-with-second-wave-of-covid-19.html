                      <h1>Is India Ready In Dealing With Second Wave Of COVID-19</h1>
                      <p class="blog-p-p">  COVID-19 / By <a href="./" class="blog-link">Dhruthi Health Care</a></p>
                      <div class="elementor-widget-container">  
                       
                        <p>Almost a week ago, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain stated that the national capital had hit its peak as far as covid cases are concerned. “The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The third wave of covid-19 is at its peak in Delhi with the cases will coming down soon,” Jain said. “One of the biggest reasons for the increase in infections is our lax behavior. If we do not wear masks, don’t follow social distancing, then it is the main reason for the surge.”The third wave comes as Delhi battles a high level of air pollution.</p>
                        <p>During the second wave, Delhi’s highest single-day case tally was 4,000. In the last ten days, Delhi has recorded more than 5,000 cases daily. Kerala has seen a spike in daily circumstances, having earlier managed to check the disease’s spread.</p>
                        <p>A SWOT analysis done by NITI Aayog in May had said that the failure in contact tracing might worsen the situation and increase the probability of a second wave.</p>
                        <p>“There is no aggressive contact tracing being done because numbers have now become very high,” said a senior health ministry official on condition of anonymity.</p>
                        <h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="color: #006d95;">HOW HAS BEEN INDIA DEALING WITH COVID-19 SO FAR?</h5>
                        <p>India was among the worst-hit countries in the first wave of Covid-19 in terms of absolute covid numbers. Still, with a relatively younger population and a higher recovery rate of 92%, the country has had better outcomes than many of its peers.</p>
                        <p>There were different approaches like that of New Zealand towards covid-19, which imposed stringent restrictions to eradicate cases. The strategy that significantly influenced India was toits borders and hunts down and kill every virus that managed to cross from the other side.<br>India’s safety was sustainable but not excellent until wishing forever to exist in a bubble with the outside of the world economy, and miraculously vaccine becomes available in the market. India acknowledges the extraordinarily nationalistic and probably only achievable goals to fight with Covid-very contained small, affluent states.</p>
                        <p>The Chief Minister said that people need to be cautious for the next six months. The Chief Minister gave the Delhi example and said the rise in Delhi infections is probably due to the high level of pollution in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“It is being said that the high levels of cases in Delhi are due to the pollution. So to avoid firecrackers this year. If the pollution levels go up, then it would affect our lungs. There is no such permanent cure or vaccine as of yet for this infection, so, please”.</p>
                        <h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="color: #006d95;">HOW COVID HAS AFFECTED THE ECONOMY&nbsp;</h5>
                        <p>A study from Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori also reveals that the government’s efforts to curtail the Pandemic in England have not succeeded in reducing the spread of COVID-19, with infection rates doubling every nine days and an estimated 960,000 people carrying the virus in England on any one day.</p>
                        <p>Investors’ worries about the steps governments might take to control new infections were heightened as EU countries tightened COVID-19 rules in the region this week.</p>
                        <p>With possible direction during Covid-19, the revision is evident because the average for states presenting their budget before the pandemic outbreak is 2.4% of GSDP. In comparison, it is 4.6% for the remaining states that made their budget presentations after the explosion. In India, many states are grappling with the Pandemic with constrained fiscal space.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In terms of primary balances, most countries incur primary deficits in 2019-20, as against primary surpluses at the onset of the global financial crisis, the RBI study said.</p>
                        <h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="color: #006d95;">HOW WILL THE SECOND WAVE OF COVID-19 AFFECT MENTAL HEALTH?</h5>
                        <p>With mental health surge already at peak, the second wave of Covid-19 will bring challenges and further challenge individuals, families, and several communities. And the increased deaths from suicide and drug overdoses with the first COVID-19 wave will disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic individuals, older adults, lower socioeconomic groups of all races and ethnicities, and health care, workers.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This devastating Pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of daily life. While nations struggle to manage the initial waves of the death and disruption associated with the epidemic, accumulating evidence indicates another “second wave” is building: rising rates of mental health and substance use disorders.</p>
                        <p>Hence the impact of Covid-19 has been collectively on behaviors of the society and state. The thoughts are indispensable in mind with the decision making with regards to the country, post-Covid-19. And the Pandemic was undoubtedly the much-needed wake-up call to the necessity of long term changes to India’s health and wellness system.</p>
                        <h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="color: #006d95;">HOW WILL SECOND WAVE OF COVID RAISE POLITICAL TENSIONS?</h5>
                        <p>Political risks manifest across four levels: geopolitical, country-level, regulatory, and societal. Some 68% and 62% of executives say country-level and geopolitical risk have a very high or high impact on their company, significantly more than those who say the same regulatory risk (47%) and societal risk (37%).</p>
                        <p>A second wave of the Pandemic will be driven by intense feelings of anxiety and despair in a world that is no longer predictable and safe due to high rates of unemployment and homelessness coupled with traumatic memories of surviving one’s brush with COVID-19 or the death of a partner, parent, or loved one.</p>
                        <p>Domestic and international politics will see significant transformations. In response to the second wave of covid, the long-term political and geopolitical risks were outlining how Covid-19 will exacerbate pre-existing domestic tensions in many countries while accelerating the trend of delocalization and pushing the US and China towards a more.</p>
                        <h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="color: #006d95;">CONCLUSION:</h5>
                        <p>With the COVID-19 Pandemic catching the world by surprise, it is no doubt that its increasing severity has called out sudden enforcements of public health measures. Implementing health measures in a country like India, especially in overcrowded living places, adequate hygiene, and sanitization has been difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Pandemic has taken a toll on Consumptions patterns, Huge financial and economic empires, Political and legal regimes, Value systems, and focused on some essential transformations the country will undergo.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Recovering from the effects of the situation like using modern tools for work and e-learning ensures minimum living standards for all. By far, the most famous pictures of the spotless skies are the few positives amidst the Covid-19.The Pandemic will change the Humanitarian perspective in the country.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Where India might become more responsible than before, looking away from the traditional conflicts and focusing more on the needs and intellectualities of people. This Pandemic will win humanitarian-needed first perception.</p>
